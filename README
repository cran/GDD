 GDD - GD Graphics device
==========================

This device produces bitmap output using libgd (aka gd library). Main
advantages compared to the "native" R bitmap drivers are speed,
support of anti-aliasing of text+lines and the fact that neither X11
nor gs is needed.

Requirements:
- libgd 2.0.29 or higher, with PNG, JPEG and GIF support
- freetype2 (optional, but without it the text output will be really bad)

Important: For licensing reasons the GDD package doesn't include TTF
fonts which are recommended to achieve the best results. Please read
the last section in this file on how to get them if they are not
installed already.

(On Debian systems, use:
  apt-get install msttcorefonts libgd2-xpm-dev
to satisfy all requirements above - other distributions are likely to have
similar packages available.)

Since GDD 0.1-6 msttcorefonts may not be necessary if fontconfig is
setup properly and you have other, Helvetica-equivalent True Type font
in your system. Nevertheless it is still recommended to use TTF fonts
as they yield better results.

Tested on unix platforms only (Linux and Mac OS X), it may or may not
work on other systems - given libgd availability. Success/failure
reports are always welcome.

When installing from sources (which is the default), make sure you
have development files (headers etc.) also installed. Also note that
the capabilities of this driver are determined by libgd and not at GDD
compile time, i.e. if you have libgd without freetype support,
installing freetype doesn't help unless you update libgd, too.

Window users: GDD was tested successfully on Windows. To install from
sources, you will have to obtain the GD DLL from:
 http://www.boutell.com/gd/http/gdwin32.zip
Unpack, set the path in Makevars.win in the GDD package and install.
In addition you will have to copy bgd.dll into $R_HOME/library/GDD/libs

TrueType Fonts: libgd supports TTF in conjunction with freetype. R
usually uses fixed font family for all texts and GDD allows the user
to specify which fonts will be used. The file basefont.mapping in the
"fonts" directory of the installed GDD package lists places where GDD
will look for font files. Currently the recommened use of GDD is in
conjunction with the Arial font from the Microsoft True Type Core
Fonts for the Web. Those can be freely redistributed, but cannot be
included in any package, so you have to download and extract them on
your own. Some Linux distributions, such as Debian offer a package
doing exactly this - downloading the fonts and extracting them. If
your distribution or operating system doesn't provide such tools, the
fonts and corresponding scripts can be obtained from:
http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/
Once unpacked, modify the basefont.mapping file of GDD to reflect the
location of the font files.

Since GDD 0.1-6 it is possible to let fontconfig search for suitable
fonts. Instead of using file names, it is possible to put fontconfig
font patterns in < > and GDD will search for them, for example
base.bold:<Arial:bold>
Will try to locate bold Arial for or any quivalent in your system.

Alternatively any TrueType or Type 1 fonts can be used. Test your
favorite font - it may work. If you have better idea as of how to
handle the fonts, please feel free to contact me.
